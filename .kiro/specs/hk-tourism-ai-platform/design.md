# Design Document

## Overview

The Hong Kong AI Tourism Platform is a comprehensive mobile and web application that leverages artificial intelligence, real-time data integration, and location-based services to provide personalized, culturally-aware tourism experiences. The platform addresses the Hong Kong Tourism Board's key challenges by transforming Hong Kong from a "stopover" to a "destination" through hyper-personalized recommendations, crowd management, authentic local experiences, and practical cultural guidance.

The system integrates multiple data sources including weather APIs, official tourism events, local business information, crowd density data, and community-generated content to create a dynamic, context-aware tourism assistant that adapts to real-time conditions and user preferences.

## Error Handling

### Error Categories and Strategies

**1. External API Failures**
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for external API calls
- Provide cached fallback data when APIs are unavailable
- Graceful degradation of features when data sources fail

**2. Location Services Errors**
- Handle GPS unavailability with manual location input
- Provide offline content for areas with poor connectivity
- Cache critical location-based content locally

**3. AI/ML Service Failures**
- Fallback to rule-based recommendations when AI services fail
- Maintain basic functionality without personalization
- Queue failed requests for retry when services recover

**4. Data Quality Issues**
- Implement data validation and sanitization pipelines
- Use confidence scores for AI-generated content
- Provide user feedback mechanisms for content quality

**Error Response Format:**
```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
    fallbackAction?: string;
    retryAfter?: number;
  };
}
```
